# SearchFixes
An improved search algorithm for Beat Saber

**Features:**
- Search by song, artist, subname or mapper name
- Search terms can be in any order and from any of those 4 categories
- Search terms are matched using "and" instead of "or" (So saying "Night Raid" will show maps that have both words, "night" and "raid"
- Special characters are ignored
